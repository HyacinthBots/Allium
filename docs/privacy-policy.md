# Allium Privacy Policy

For an overview of Alliums's features and capabilities, please visit the associated document for [commands](https://github.com/NotJansel/Allium/tree/root/docs/commands.md).

The developer of Allium is not a lawyer and does not have the resources to hire lawyers. I have, to the best of my ability, written this document clearly, concisely, and accurately. If you have any questions, please see the `Contact` section.

With this the only person to access the data described below is Jansel and his hosting provider.

## Data

Allium only logs errors when they occur and provides these to Jansel immediately. Else no data is collected.
