# Allium Privacy Policy

For an overview of Alliums's features and capabilities, please visit the associated document for [commands](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/Allium/tree/root/docs/commands.md).

The developer of Allium is not a lawyer and does not have the resources to hire lawyers. I have, to the best of my ability, written this document clearly, concisely, and accurately. If you have any questions, please see the `Contact` section.

With this the only person to access the data described below is Jansel and his hosting provider.

## Data

Allium uses a Database to store Channel and Guild ID's for the Log Uploading Feature. Data will be stored as long the Bot is in the Guild. As soon it leaves it, any data in connection to that guild will be removed.

## Contact

For questions, you may email me at github@notjansel.de. You may also contact Jansel#0001 on Discord.
